We are working with the NC bike crashes dataset. When manipulating data, remember we always start with this dataset, and then **pipe** in additional functions. For instance:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  function1() %>%
  function2() %>%
  lastFunction() 
```

#### Filter for bike crashes in Residential development areas where driver age group is 0 to 19.

```{r filter-age}

```

#### Identify the most commonly occurring estimated speed for drivers.

Hint: You can `count` observations of the variable `driver_est_speed`

```{r speed}

```

#### What is the mean hour for when a crash occurs in Durham County for each month?

```{r when-crash-durham}

```
